# flightscheduler
Flight scheduler written in C displaying structs, pointers, and linked lists

Assignment from Boston University's CS 210 from Fall 2021. Scheduler is implemented as a doubly linked list where a user can add and remove flights and destinations from a flight schedule. Flight schedules are designed as structs and maintain an array of flights (also a struct) that have pointers to the next and previous itens of the double linked list. 
Time is implemented as the number of minutes since midnight. 
All code after line 302 is implemented by me.
